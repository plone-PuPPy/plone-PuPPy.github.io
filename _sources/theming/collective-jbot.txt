Customize template on the fly: collective.jbot
==============================================

..  warning::

    Not yet compatible with Plone 5!


Back in the old days we used to customize views' templates from the tool `portal_view_customizations` from the ZMI.

This tool has no UI and could beat you whenever you don't expect it.

So, `Nathan Van Gheem <https://twitter.com/vangheezy>`_ has created this package that unfortunately is not (yet!) part of the core: `collective.jbot <https://github.com/collective/collective.jbot>`_.

This package uses the well-known `z3c.jbot` under the hood and allows you to customize templates TTW from the control panel.
