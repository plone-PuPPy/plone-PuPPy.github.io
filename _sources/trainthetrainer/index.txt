Train the Trainer: How to give technical training
=================================================

..  warning::

    This chapter will likely only interest you if you want to give a Plone
    training, it does not contain any material on Plone.

..  warning::
    
    This chapter is also a work in progress
    

    It's not specifically written for Mastering Plone but could be useful in
    giving any technical training and will hopefully be a support for your
    first Plone educational experience in front of the room. It contains
    feedback and 'lessons learned' from previous Plone trainings and personal
    experience.
