    This chapter is a work in progress

This chapter will contain some background on learning, mental models that people use in different ways, how to improve remembering and understanding of knowledge, training rhythm and attention span, etc. etc.

These are helpfull both before, during and after a training, that's why we have put them in a separate chapter you should read before you start writing or improving training material.
