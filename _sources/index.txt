Mastering Plone!
================

This is the documentation for the "Mastering Plone" training.

Mastering Plone is intended as a week-long training for people who are new to Plone or want to learn about the current best practices of Plone development. It can be split in two trainings:

- A beginner training (2 to 3 days) that covers chapters 1-18.
- An advanced training (3 to 5 days) that covers the rest.

Please note that this document is *not complete* without the spoken word of a trainer. Even though we attempt to include the most important parts of what we teach in the narrative but reading it here can in no way be considered equal to attending a training.
