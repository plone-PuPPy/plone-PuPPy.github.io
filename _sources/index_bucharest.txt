Mastering Plone!
================

This is the documentation for the "Mastering Plone" training.

Mastering Plone is intended as a week-long training for people who are new to Plone or want to learn about the current best practices of Plone development. It can be split in two trainings:

- A beginner training (2 to 3 days) that covers chapters 1-18.
- An advanced training (3 to 5 days) that covers the rest.


..  warning::

    For the duration of the `Plone Conference 2015 in Bucharest <https://2015.ploneconf.org>`_ the navigation has been modified to only reflect the `trainings given at the conference <https://2015.ploneconf.org/trainings>`_. You can find the original order :doc:`here <original_index>`. Please note that the next-previous-buttons and the global navigation on the left side will not work for the original order!

Please note that this document is not complete without the spoken word of a trainer. Even though we attempt to include the most important parts of what we teach in the narrative but reading it here can in no way be considered equal to attending a training.
